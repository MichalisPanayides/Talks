# **Story Board**:

## 1. Intro
- About me
- Congestion x Game Theory x Behaviour

## 2. Motivation
- Congestion in EDs
- Ambulances wait for a long time outside of hospitals (blocked)
  - Good: Patients have their own paramedic
  - Bad: Ambulances blocked - can't get more patients
- NHS: regulations - patients need to be seen within 4 hours
- QUEUEING THEORY AND GAME THEORY


## 3. Representation of hospital
- Structure
- Threshold
- Performance measures

## 4. Game
- Game
- 2 Hospitals + 1 Ambulance
- Distribute patients to hospitals


## 5. Players, Strategies, Objectives
- Players
- Strategies
  - High Threshold = Low congestion
  - Low Threshold = High congestion
- Objectives
  - High time target = Low congestion
  - Low time target = High congestion


## 6. Evolutionary Game Theory
- Asymmetric Replicator Dynamics


## 7. Results
- Hospitals with 10 possible strategies/Thresholds
- Time target = 1.5
  - Thresholds = 1, 2
- Time target = 1.7
  - Thresholds = 3, 5
- Time target = 2
  - Thresholds = 10, 10
- Incentivisation
  - Escape already learned strategies
