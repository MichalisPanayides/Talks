# Me
- 4th year PhD student in Maths
- Cardiff University, THIS
- Supervisors
- Any questions, feel free to interrupt me

# Introduction to my research
- Motivation
- Queueing theory + Game theory

# Brief queueing theory intro
- Queueing theory in general
- Diagram
- Performance measures

# My queues
- My queueing network
- Mention performance measures

# Initial form of my game
- The game in general
- Players - strategies - objectives
- Imperfect information extensive-form game representation
  - Normal form games - simultaneous games
  - Extensive form games - sequential games
- Reducing to normal-form game

# Methodology
- Routing matrix
- Utility of the hospitals

# Nash equilibrium and asymmetric replicator dynamics
- N.E. algorithms
- Learning algorithms
  - Fictitious play: iterative learning algorithm

# Nash equilibrium
- Example
- Strategies: T = (1, 2, 3, 4)
- All N.E using support enumeration and Lemke-Howson algorithm


# Replicator dynamics
- Used to express the evolutionary dynamics of a population of entities
  - Population of agents (replicators) with different characteristics
  - Agents (with different characteristics) meet and interact
  - Interaction generates payoff
  - Over time, this population evolves
  - Matrix A represents these interaction
  - Replicator dynamics equation

# Asymmetric replicator dynamics
- Non-symmetric version of replicator dynamics
- Replicator dynamics - 1 type of agent with different characteristics
- Asymmetric replicator dynamics - 2 types of agents with different characteristics

# Evolutionary stable strategies
- Game theory: replicators are strategies
- Stable population
- Evolutionary stable strategies: resistant to invasive strategies

# ARD on my game
- ARD example where target = 1.5
- ARD example where target = 1.7
- ARD example where target = 2
