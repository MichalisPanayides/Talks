# A 3-player game theoretic model of a choice between two queueing systems with strategic managerial decision making

The main focus of this research is the construction of a 3-player game theoretic
model between two queueing systems and a service that distributes individuals to
them. 
The resultant model is then used to explore dynamics between all players.

The first aspect of this work is the development of a queueing system with two
consecutive waiting spaces. 
The strategic managerial behaviour corresponds to how individuals use these
waiting spaces. 
Two modelling techniques were used: discrete event simulation and Markov chains.
The state probabilities of the Markov chain system have been used to extract the
performance measures of the queueing model (e.g. mean time in each waiting room,
mean number of individuals in each room, etc.).

This particular system can be applied in a healthcare scenario where it captures
the emergent behaviour between the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and the
Emergency Department (ED).
This will be used to investigate the impact of target measures on patient
welfare.
