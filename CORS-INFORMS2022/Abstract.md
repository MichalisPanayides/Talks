# Recovering from inefficiencies in queueing systems with two consecutive waiting zones

The main focus of this research is the development of a 3-player game between 
two queueing systems and a service that distributes individuals to them. 
The resultant model is then used to explore how the two queueing systems can 
escape certain learned inefficiencies.

The first aspect of this work is the creation of a queueing system with two 
consecutive waiting zones. 
Such a system is modelled using discrete event simulation and Markov chains. 
Both methods have been used to extract the performance measures of the queueing
model (e.g mean waiting time in each room, mean number of individuals in each 
room). 
The second part of the work is to model the behaviours that emerge from the 
game theoretic model
between two such queueing systems and a service that distributes 
individuals to them. 
Concepts like the Nash equilibrium and learning algorithms were 
applied to the game to explore dynamics that arise between the players.

The above model is applied in a healthcare scenario between the Emergency 
Medical Services (EMS) and two Emergency Departments (EDs) and can be used to 
capture the emergent behaviour at the EMS/ED interface. 
In particular by utilising game theoretic learning algorithms (e.g. asymmetric 
replicator dynamics) we can investigate how players arrive at inefficient 
behaviours. 
In addition, these emerged inefficiencies are explored along with ways to apply 
some incentive mechanism to escape them.
