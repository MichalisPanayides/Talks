# Recovering from inefficiencies in queueing systems with two consecutive waiting zones

The focus of this research is the development of a 3-player game between two 
queueing systems and a service that distributes individuals to them. 
The first aspect of this work is the creation of a queueing system with two 
consecutive waiting zones.
The second part is modelling the behaviours that emerge from the game theoretic
model between two such queueing systems and a service distributing individuals
to them.
The model is applied in a healthcare setting between an ambulance service and
two hospitals.
In particular by using learning algorithms we can investigate how players arrive
at inefficient behaviours along with ways to apply some incentive mechanism to
escape them.
