- Structure: Game theory + Ambulance Application (together)

# GAME THEORY
## Game theory intro
- General: study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational agents
- Players, Strategies, Utilities
- Normal form games

## Rock, Paper, Scissors example
- Players, Strategies, Utilities

## Prisoner's Dilemma game
- Explain the game
- Formulate the game
- Explain repeated games
- Divide to teams and play game - RULES:
  - Clearly explain all outcomes: CC, DD, CD, DC
  - Everyone plays with everyone
  - Every game consists of 5 rounds
  - Every round, each team chooses a strategy
  - Combine all points from all rounds
  - Your goal is to have the most points at the end of all matches
  - Previous rounds will be visible

## Strategies
- Cooperator, Defector, Tit-for-tat
- Axelrod tournament

## Solving the game
- Nash equilibrium
- Learning algorithms
  - Evolutionary stable strategies
  - Asymmetric replicator dynamics


# AMBULANCE APPLICATION
## Application and queueing theory intro
- Queueing theory in general
- Diagram
- Performance measures

## My queues
- My queueing network
- Mention performance measures

## Game Formulation
- The game in general
- Players - strategies - objectives
- Imperfect information extensive-form game representation
  - Normal form games - simultaneous games
  - Extensive form games - sequential games
- Reducing to normal-form game
- Utility of the hospitals

## Nash equilibrium and asymmetric replicator dynamics
- N.E. algorithms
- Learning algorithms
  - Fictitious play: iterative learning algorithm

## Nash equilibrium
- Example
- Strategies: T = (1, 2, 3, 4)
- All N.E using support enumeration and Lemke-Howson algorithm


## Replicator dynamics
- Used to express the evolutionary dynamics of a population of entities
  - Population of agents (replicators) with different characteristics
  - Agents (with different characteristics) meet and interact
  - Interaction generates payoff
  - Over time, this population evolves
  - Matrix A represents these interaction
  - Replicator dynamics equation

## Asymmetric replicator dynamics
- Non-symmetric version of replicator dynamics
- Replicator dynamics - 1 type of agent with different characteristics
- Asymmetric replicator dynamics - 2 types of agents with different characteristics

## Evolutionary stable strategies
- Game theory: replicators are strategies
- Stable population
- Evolutionary stable strategies: resistant to invasive strategies

## ARD on my game
- ARD example where target = 1.5
- ARD example where target = 1.7
- ARD example where target = 2
